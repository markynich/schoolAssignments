Homework #7 : Binary Search Tree

Brief Summary:
  This program reads in a file called "input.txt", which contains random
  numbers that have been generated by a script. It will store the numbers into
  a binary search tree and a queue. After it reads the whole file, it will print
  the two lists next to each other, one that is a copy of the list that was
  written into "input.txt" and one that will be in order. The output will be
  printed into a file called "output.txt".

Files:
  BST.h
  BST.cpp
  main.cpp
  ranNumGenerator.sh
  main
  input.txt
  output.txt

File Description:
  BST.h:
    Header file for class BST which contains functions and variables
    to create binary search tree and queues.
  BST.cpp:
    Implementation file for the functions within BST class:
      BST: constructor to set root node to NULL
      ~BST: destructor to set root node back to NULL and delete root node
      readList:
        Take's in 1 parameter which is a reference to ifstream object.
        Makes sure each read line is not empty and stores the number into
        BST and Queue.
      printTreeIO:
        Calls printTreeInOrder
      newNode: (PrivateFunction)
        Creates a new node, sets left and right pointer to NULL. Gets ready to
        attach to BST
      insertNode:(PrivateFunction)
        Locates where the newNode needs to be attached
      printTreeInOrder:(PrivateFunction)
        Prints BST in order and the Queue list next to each other into "output.txt"
  main.cpp:
    Driver file for program. Creates 1 class object, 2 fstream objects.
    Reads in "input.txt" passes the object into a function and then writes
    in "output.txt" by passing the object into another function.
  ranNumGenerator:
    Bash script file to randomly generate 120 numbers into "input.txt" from
    range(1-500). run "chmod 777 ranNumGenerator.sh" to be able to execute script
  main:
    executable file for program
  input.txt:
    file that contains 120 numbers for the program to read to use as a num list
  output.txt:
    file that contains 2 lists, 1 that is not ordered and 1 in order by BST
