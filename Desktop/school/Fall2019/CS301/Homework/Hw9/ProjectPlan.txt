Homework #9 : Sorting

Brief Summary:
	This program reads an input file which reads commands to run different
	sorting functions to test which sorting function is faster. It will print out
	the output to the name the user inputs

Files:
	all.log
	BubbleSort.h
	InsertionSort.h
	main
	main.cpp
	MergeSort.h
	QuickSort.h
	QuickSort2.h
	SelectionSort.h
	ShortBubble.h
	Sorts.in
	Swap.h

all.log:
	output of the command executions
BubbleSort.h:
	Sorting function which compares from index to index-1
InsertionSort.h:
	Sorting function which go through the index and finds 1 element at a time
	pushing the list forward or backward to insert element
main:
	executable file to run program
main.cpp:
	driver file which has the implementation of reading the commands
	and recording how long each sort function takes
MergeSort.h:
	Sorting function which breaks down the list and sorts until the list
	is together and is fully sorted
QuickSort.h:
	Sorting function which breaks the list into partitions and sorts the
	partitions and combines them until it is fully sorted
QuickSort2.h:
	Similar to QuickSort.h, but it is premade from auther/professor
SelectionSort.h:
	Sorting function which go through the index and finds 1 element at a time
ShortBubble.h:
	Similar to BubbleSort.h except the function has a helper function
Sorts.in:
	Input file for commands to execute
Swap.h:
	swap function to swap elements from the list
