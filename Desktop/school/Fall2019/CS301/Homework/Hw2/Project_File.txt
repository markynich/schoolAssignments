Assignment #2

This assignment gets a user input of 1 - 25
and prints out each permutation into a file
called output.txt

This project uses 2 files:
  1. header file "permutation.h"
  2. driver file "main.cpp"

The project contains 5 files:
  1. header file "permutation.h"
  2. driver file "main.cpp"
  3. picture of example output file
  4. picture of example command line output
  5. Project file to explain the contents

Project functions:
  Standard Setters & Getters for size of array
  Standard constructor(not overloaded) & deconstructor
  writeIntoFile:
    Opens the fstream and if "output.txt" is not created, it will create the file.
    Each permutation gets added into the file and the file appends each line
    to the bottom
  storeArr:
    Stores the numbers from 1 - [userinput] into the array
  permute:
    swaps numbers and recalls itself to create the permutations.
    After the permutation is created, it will call writeIntoFile to add
    into the file.
