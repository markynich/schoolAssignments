Project Plan
Assignment 1

This project uses three files:
  1 header file called number_bucket.h
  1 driver file called main.cpp
  1 picture file called screenshort_assignment1.png

The number_bucket.h file contains a class called number_bucket
that contains functions, constructor, destructor, and a private stack to store
the numbers in a LIFO format.
Functions:
  getNumber - get number within top of stack
  getBucket - print out stack from top to bottom
  push - insert number within stack
  pop - remove number within stack in LIFO order
  isEmpty - to check the stack is empty or not empty
  get_size - get the size of the stack

The main.cpp file creates a class object called numBucket to use the functions
within the class.
Also, the driver class a few steps:
  1. to show the constructor is initialized
  2. check the stack is empty
  3. add 10 numbers in the stack with push function
  4. check the stack is not empty
  5. print out the stack
  6. remove 3 numbers in LIFO order with pop function
  7. check the stack is not empty
  8. print out the stack to show 3 numbers are gone
  9. clear out the stack
  10. check the stack is empty
  11. Destructor is called.
