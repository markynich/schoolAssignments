Homework #2

C++ Code Generator (syntactically correct)

This homework assignment generates syntactically correct code in C++.
After running the program a few times, it was becoming apparent that the code
generated would not run. The program uses integers for loops that don't make sense
and variables that have not been initialized. My approach to this would be to
initialize the variables first before using them, make sure that the loop expressions
will not use only integers. It will make sure that loop expressions are only variables
or <exp> <op> <exp>.
