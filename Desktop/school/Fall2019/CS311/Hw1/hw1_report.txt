Assignment #1 Report

Brief Summary:

This assignment was very tedious as there were a lot of features I had to remove
because C did not have them. Some of the features were namespace, vectors, some
libraries, templates, strings(as you discussed in class), cout, cin, etc. However,
it was pretty fun as I have never coded in C before so it was nice seeing the
big difference between the two languages.
One of the two hardest parts of this assignment was figuring out what needed to
be changed from C++ to C. This homework assignment had a lot of C++ only functions
which had to be intentional as every time I changed something, the compiler
would tell me something else. For some reason, I was not about to reference my
char variables for passing arguments within functions, but I think that was on
my part.
The other hardest part of this assignment was flushing buffers. I didn't know how
easy C++ made it for us with cout & cin. I had to learn how to buffer out extra data
from reading strings, or using "\n" or even just reading a char. It's nice that
C has a function for flushing the buffers, but "StackOverlow" says it is bad
practice to use it. C programming kind of reminds me of Assembly which is why I
enjoyed this assignment.
Also, sorry for my terrible variable naming & ugly code. I was in a hurry and I
know it is very bad practice.
