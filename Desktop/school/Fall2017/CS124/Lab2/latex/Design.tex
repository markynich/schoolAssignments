The program first prints out and tells the user it is printing out the first output of the program which is the basic insert function with the list of cities. The program then destroys the list and prints out again which tells the user it is empty. Then it prints out the second version of the list which is in alphbetical order. It then repeats the cycle which destroys the list again and tries to print out the list, but tells the user it is empty. Lastly, the third print out of the list prints the list backwards as it written. Then ends the program.
