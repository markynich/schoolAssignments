The program will run an executable file called \char`\"{}lab\char`\"{} which is a bunch of files that are compiled into one runnable file. When \char`\"{}lab\char`\"{} is executed, it tells the user how many words and vectors are in the file called \char`\"{}dict.\+dat\char`\"{}, which is the dictionary. The dictionary is loaded into the program and is asking the user which word would he/she would want to translate into tagalog. If the word is not in the dictionary, he/she is asked if they would like to add the word into the dictionary with the translation. If they do not, they may exit and continue more translations, but if they want to add a translation, they can add the word and then the translation into the dictionary which is 'dict.\+dat'
