The desgin is to have html to display our input and output and have the C++ do all of the work. we have a total of 5 functions. open\+Tree.\+cpp\+: Builds the tree needed for the morse code translations.\+Sets the root node to null and builds from the tree from that function builds from the Morse table structure from the privateclass. encode.\+cpp\+: Converts text into morse code. It finds each symbol in the table(skips it if not found). decode.\+cpp\+: Converts morse code into text. It follows the path determined from the string parameter and once it reaches the end, it stores the letter in the string named text which is returned at the end of the functions. close\+Tree.\+cpp Destroys the tree that was built with the build\+Tree function. Uses recursion to destroy each node of the tree.
