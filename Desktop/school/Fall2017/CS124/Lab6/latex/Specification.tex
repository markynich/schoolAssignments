In this project, we will simulate a telegraph station that can encode messages from text to Morse code and decode Morse code back to text. The encoding is accomplished by looking up a symbol in a table and copying its Morse code into the output string. The decoding is implemented with the help of a binary \char`\"{}decoding\char`\"{} tree. Morse code for each letter represents a path from the root of the tree to some node\+: a \char`\"{}dot\char`\"{} means go left, and a \char`\"{}dash\char`\"{} means go right. The node at the end of the path contains the symbol corresponding to the code.
