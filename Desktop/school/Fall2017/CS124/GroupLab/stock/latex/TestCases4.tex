Now don't worry Kush. Although, your request has yet to be fufilled. My buddy Ganja thinks your prices are a bit too much for him and thinks he has a good offer for a lower price. Now when Ganja sends his request, since Kush is the only one selling Amazon stocks but for a higher price. We would expect Ganja to get a similar output but instead it would say that \char`\"{}there are no sellers found and your submission is pending\char`\"{}.
