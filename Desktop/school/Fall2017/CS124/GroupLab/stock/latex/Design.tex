They are given five different companies in a drop down bar to choose from. Once the user has chosen a company, they are given the option to either sell or buy. After the user has chosen one of those two options, the user is then, asked to give their name, shares amount, and price. After the user has entered the following, the program will then execute and insert the information into the heap tree and search through the heap tree.
