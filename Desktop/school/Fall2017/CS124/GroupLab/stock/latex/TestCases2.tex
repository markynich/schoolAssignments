Let's say my buddy Kush wants to sell some of his Amazon stocks, but there are currently no buyers. We would expect that after clicking the go button. We would be redirected to an html page telling us if our transaction went through. Since no one is currently investing in Amazon, we should expect an output saying \char`\"{}no buyer found\char`\"{} and \char`\"{}a request pending\char`\"{}.
