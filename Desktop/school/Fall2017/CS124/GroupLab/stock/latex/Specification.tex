This is a stock program which is a system for trading in a dozen stocks. The system maintains the list of all active buy and sell orders for each stock that the customer has entered. In this system, the customer can log in, give his or her name, request quotes and place orders. An order holds the name of the customer, a buy or sell indicator, the stock symbol, the number of shares and a price limit. This system keeps all buy orders for each stock in a priority queue ranked by the bid price, and all sell orders in an inverted priority queue with the smallest \char`\"{}ask\char`\"{} price order on top.
